CloudCross it\'s opensource software for synchronization of local files and folders with various cloud storages\. On this moment CloudCross supports working with Google Drive, Dropbox, Yandex\.Disk and Cloud Mail\.ru\. This program was written on pure Qt, without any third\-party libraries\. The program works with Qt version 5 and above\. Qt version 4\.x are not supported\.
.
.P
CloudCross allows you to sync only a portion of the local/remote files and folders using black or white lists (\.include and \.exclude files)\. At the same time you have the opportunity to choose which files have the advantage \- local or remote\. Thus, you can keep relevance either local files or files on cloud storage\.
.
.P
In addition, CloudCross supports automatic bidirectional conversion of documents from MS Office or Open Office format to Google Docs\. Also, you can control the versioning of files synchronized on Google Drive\.
